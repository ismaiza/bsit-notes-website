<h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept
of objects. Objects contain data and methods that operate on the data.
</p>

<h2>Core Principles of OOP</h2>

<h3>1. Encapsulation</h3>
<p>
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data
into a single unit called a class.
</p>

<h3>2. Abstraction</h3>
<p>
Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features.
</p>

<h3>3. Inheritance</h3>
<p>
Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods of another class.
<h3>a. Types of Inheritance</h3> 
<P>
single inheritance,multiple inheritance,hybrid inheritance,


<h3>4. Polymorphism</h3>
<p>
Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different data types.

 <h3>a. Static polymorphism</h3>:
 
  its achieve through method overloading and operator overloading
  method overloading involves defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists
  within the same class
 <h3>b. Dynamic Polymorphism</h3>:
    also know as runtime polymorphism is achieve through method overiding and interface implementation.
</p>
<h2>3. Advantages of OOP</h2>
<p>
OOP improves code reusability, security, and maintainability.
It makes large software systems easier to manage.
</p>

<h2>4. OOP Concepts Example</h2>
<p>
A class is a blueprint, while an object is an instance of a class.
For example, a "Car" is a class, and "Toyota" is an object.
