<h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept
of objects. Objects contain data and methods that operate on the data.
</p>

<h2>Core Principles of OOP</h2>

<h3>. Encapsulation</h3>
<p>
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data
into a single unit called a class.
</p>

<h3>. Abstraction</h3>
<p>
Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features.
</p>

<h3>. Inheritance</h3>
<p>
Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods of another class.
<h3>a. Types of Inheritance</h3> 
<P>
  <li>single inheritance</li>
  <li>multiple inheritance</Li>
 <li> hybrid inheritance</li>


<h3>. Polymorphism</h3>
<p>
Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different data types.

 <h3>a. Static polymorphism</h3>:
 
  its achieve through method overloading and operator overloading
  method overloading involves defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists
  within the same class
 <h3>b. Dynamic Polymorphism</h3>:
    also know as runtime polymorphism is achieve through method overiding and interface implementation.
  <h3>Object</h3>
<p>
  Object are the basics run-time entities in an object oriented system.They may represent a person,a place or a item that
  the program must handle.
  <h2>Class</h2>
<p>
  A group of object that share common properties for data part and some program part are collectively called class.
  <h2>Benefits of OOP<h2>
  <p>
    . it helps faster development of software
    . it easy to maintain
    . multiple instances of object can co-exist without any interferance
    . can be easily upgraded from small to large systems
    . inheritance eliminates redundant code 
    <h2>Application of OOP</h2>
  <p>
    . Real-Time system
    . Object oriented databases
    . Al and expert systems
    . Simulation and modeling
    
<h2>. Advantages of OOP</h2>
<p>
<li>OOP improves code reusability</li>
<li>security and maintainability</li>
<li>It makes large software systems easier to manage</li>
</p>

<h2>. Arithmetic,Condition and Logical Operator</h2>
<p>
  An operator is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands,producing result
 <h2> Arithmetic Operators</h2> : are used to perform mathematical operation on numerical operands (+ - * % ++ )
  <h2>Condition Operators</h2> : are used to perform comparisons and make decision based on condition(== > < <= >=)
  <h2>Logical Operators</h2> : are used to perform logical operations on Boolen operands AND(&&) OR(||) NOT(!)

 <h2>if.....Else Statement</h2> 
  <p>
    if condition Then
        'Statement to execute if condition is True
    Else 
         'Statemnt to execute if condition is False
    <h2>1. if Statement</h2>
<p>
The <strong>if statement</strong> is used to execute a block of code
when a condition is true.
</p>

<pre>
if (condition) {
    // code executes if condition is true
}
</pre>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are eligible to vote");
}
</pre>

<hr>

<h2>2. if – else Statement</h2>
<p>
The <strong>if–else statement</strong> executes one block if the condition
is true and another block if it is false.
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
int number = 5;

if (number % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Even number");
} else {
    System.out.println("Odd number");
}
</pre>

<hr>

<h2>3. while Loop</h2>
<p>
The <strong>while loop</strong> executes a block of code repeatedly
as long as the condition is true.
</p>

<pre>
while (condition) {
    // repeated code
}
</pre>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
int i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
</pre>

<p class="tip">Note: The condition is checked before the loop executes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. do–while Loop</h2>
<p>
The <strong>do–while loop</strong> executes the code at least once,
then checks the condition.
</p>

<pre>
do {
    // code executes
} while (condition);
</pre>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
int i = 1;

do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
</pre>

<p class="tip">Difference: do–while runs at least once even if condition is false.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. switch Statement</h2>
<p>
The <strong>switch statement</strong> is used to select one block
from many options.
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
int day = 3;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
</pre>

<hr>

<h2>6. Loops in OOP</h2>
<p>
Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.
Common loops include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>for loop</li>
    <li>while loop</li>
    <li>do–while loop</li>
</ul>

<h3>for Loop Example:</h3>
<pre>
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
</pre>
